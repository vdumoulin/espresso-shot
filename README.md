# E61 Temperature Monitoring and Control System

This repository contains the source code for an Arduino-powered temperature
monitoring and control system for espresso machines with an E61 grouphead. The
project is heavily inspired by [Howard Smith's setup](https://www.home-barista.com/tips/guide-to-managing-hx-brew-temperatures-t64840.html), which uses a small DC
fan to cool the grouphead instead of the usual cooling flush. This approach has
the advantage of not wasting water, which is good both environmentally and
financially.

I started this project to address an overheating issue on my Sanremo Treviso
espresso machine and figured others might also benefit from it, which is why I'm
open-sourcing the code and circuit design. This is not meant to be an easy and
straightforward build guide, but rather a (hopefully) useful starting point for
people interested in building something similar.
